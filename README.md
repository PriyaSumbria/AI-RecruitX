# AI-RecruitX
Semantic Resume Analyzer &amp; Job Matching System using NLP and AI
##  Description
**AI-RecruitX** is an AI-based recruitment assistance platform that helps candidates analyze how well their resumes match a given job description using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The system focuses on semantic similarity rather than keyword matching and is designed with an API-based architecture.  

The platform also aims to support interview preparation by collecting and analyzing interview-related data. The interview practice module is currently under development.
